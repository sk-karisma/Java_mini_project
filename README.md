# MOVIE BOOKING SYSTEM

- This application allows users to book movies, cancel booking and view bookings. They can only cancel or view upcoming bookings.<br/>
- Staff can add movies with start and end date and view the current movies.<br/>
- Users will be provided with movies open for booking. When they choose a movie, they will be shown the dates on which it is available. When they choose a date, they will be provided with the upcoming time slots on that day. When they select the time slot, they will be provided with a layout of seats from where they can book the available seats. Booked seats will turn red.<br/>
- The bookings made by users and movies added by staff will be saved in text files so that changes made won't be lost.
